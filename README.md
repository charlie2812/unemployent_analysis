Time series trend analysis of overall unemployment.
Comparative study of labour participation rate vs unemployment rate.
Key Findings
States X, Y, and Z have the highest unemployment rates. (Replace X, Y, Z with actual states)
There's a negative correlation between labour participation rate and unemployment.
Future Work
Integrate more recent datasets to keep the analysis current.
Predictive modeling to forecast unemployment rates.
Dive deeper into reasons behind unemployment using external datasets.
